Areas to check:

- all boundary/center-size coordinates are expressed as fractions [0, 1] wrt input image size

- the folding of Fully Connected layers into Conv layers are done correctly, in that the parameter positions are correct after folding

- "Priors are manually but carefully chosen based on the shapes and sizes of ground truth objects in our dataset." - re-examine whether predefined prior boxes make sense for coco dataset
